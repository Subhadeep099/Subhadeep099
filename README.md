# Hi there, I'm Subhadeep Kanjilal! 👋

<!--### ⚛️ Physics Major & Scientific Computing Enthusiast-->

I am a physics student passionate about using code to solve complex physical problems. I focus on **Computational Physics**, translating mathematical models—like Differential Equations and Quantum Mechanics—into Python simulations. I’m deeply interested in creating meaningful, creative content and solving real-world problems with an entrepreneurial mindset.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On
I am currently building a library of **Numerical Methods** to solve physical systems. Some of my key implementations include:

* **Quantum Mechanics:** Solving the **Schrödinger Wave Equation** and plotting wave functions.
* **Differential Equations:** Using **Euler’s Method** and the **Shooting Method** for dynamic systems.
* **Root Finding:** Implementing **Newton-Raphson** and **Bisection methods** for high-precision analysis.
